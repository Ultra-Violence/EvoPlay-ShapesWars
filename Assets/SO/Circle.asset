  history: We, the circles, have been oppressed by the squares for thousands of years,
    but this could not go on forever.  Our round gods sent you to us so that you
    could at least take revenge. Be careful, though, the treacherous squares have
    made an alliance with our other natural enemies, the triangles. Their sharp angles
    have long been a problem for our people. The best thing you can do is to avoid
    collisions with triangles and destroy square fools. Good luck!!!
