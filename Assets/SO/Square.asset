  history: We, the squares, have been oppressed by the triangles for thousands of
    years, but this could not go on forever. Our square gods sent you to us so that
    you could at least take revenge. Be careful, though, the treacherous triangles
    have made an alliance with our other natural enemies, the circles. Our hard shell
    has always lost to their soft one. The best thing you can do is avoid collisions
    with circles and destroy the triangular fools. Good luck!!!
