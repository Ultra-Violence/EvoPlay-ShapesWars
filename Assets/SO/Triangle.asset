  history: We, the triangles, have been oppressed by the circles for thousands of
    years, but this could not go on forever.  Our triangular gods sent you to us
    so that you could at least take revenge. But beware, the treacherous circles
    have allied themselves with our other natural enemies, the squares. Their blunt
    sides have long been a problem for our people. The best thing you can do is to
    avoid clashes with squares and destroy round fools. Good luck!!!
